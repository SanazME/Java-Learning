// It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and

// Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to
// simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).
// Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.
